### Project Description
 LegalBot is a chatbot designed to assist legal professionals, researchers, and individuals seeking legal advice by delivering accurate and contextual responses to complex legal queries. The chatbot leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the quality of its responses, ensuring they are both relevant and well-informed.

With its ability to perform semantic searches and generate responses using Google Generative AI, LegalBot aims to simplify legal research, streamline document analysis, and provide quick access to legal insights
### The Problem statement
The problem being addressed by this project is the lack of accessible and efficient legal assistance for individuals who may not have the resources to consult a lawyer or navigate complex legal systems. Legal research and advice can be time-consuming and expensive, and this bot aims to democratize access to legal information by:

Providing quick and accurate responses to legal queries.

Reducing the dependency on human lawyers for preliminary legal advice.

Making legal information more accessible to the general public.
### The Solution
[The primary objective of the RAG_LegalBot is to provide automated legal assistance by answering user queries related to legal matters. The bot aims to:

Retrieve relevant legal information or case laws from a database.

Generate accurate, concise, and contextually appropriate responses to user queries.

Assist users in understanding legal concepts, finding relevant case laws, or getting guidance on legal procedures.]
